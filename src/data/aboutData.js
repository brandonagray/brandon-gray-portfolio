		I love solving problems (which is why I enjoy coding)! But problem solving
		isn't about sitting in a board room talking about the way things should be
		done. I have a strong background in design which allows me to think on my
		feet and act upon it. My skills & experience allow me to come up with
		creative solutions that form perfect harmonies between form and function
		while maintaining the highest levels of aesthetic standard.
	</span>,
	<span>
		I've found that the key to creating great interactive experiences comes from
		understanding what the client and user needs, among other things. The
		essential stage of concept development, planning is at the heart of any
		successful project. I take great care to ensure all the necessary steps are
		taken to produce stellar results every time.
	</span>,
	<span>
		It also takes talent, knowledge, hard work, and dedication to make great
		ideas come to life. With 10+ years of experience now under my belt, I'm not
		afraid of a challenge. New technologies get me excited and I love jumping
		right in and getting things done, untangling problems and learning the
		lessons that unfold with each project.
	</span>,
	<span>
		While my focus is on the front end - designing and developing intuitive,
		stylistic and user friendly web interfaces - I'm extremely interested in the
		workings of the entire web stack. Stemming from the fact that I'm a very
		visual learner, I have a deep fascination with user interfaces and UX
		design. I love trawling the web for interesting articles on stuff like
		human-computer interactions and subtle effects on user experience are my
		bread and butter. It's a major contributing factor to why I also use tools
		like Adobe XD and InVision.
	</span>,
	<span>
		When I'm not in front of a computer, I thoroughly enjoy more hands-on
		creative endeavors - pottery and mosaic making have become a fun pasttime
		for me. Other interests of mine include keeping fit with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
		ü§ôüèø, fencing ü§∫, cooking, and travelling (I'm currently on a year long
		working-holiday in New Zealand!).
	</span>,
	<span>
		If you've made it this far, thanks for reading ü•Ç! I'm always looking for
		new opportunities. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an
		email, or reach out on social media!
